\maketitle

\begin{abstract}%   <- trailing '%' for backward compatibility of .sty file
The abstract is a short (one paragraph) summary of your project idea and findings. It should contain all the necessary info a reader needs to have to quickly understand what you did and why it is valuable to read your paper
\end{abstract}

\section{Problem Statement}

    This needs to clearly answer the “What” question.
    It should be easy to understand for a broad audience in the area (and more specifically, the TAs ;) ).
    Please clarify the input (i.e. domain you are working on) and the output (how do you quantify optimal decision making).
    State clearly what tasks you are trying to solve or what kinds of algorithms you are proposing.
    Whenever applicable, cite relevant work here \cite{chow:68,pearl:88,claas}

\section{Motivation and Impact}

    This should answer the “Why” question.
    Why do this? Is there a need that you forsee, or does it answer a previously posed question?
    And more importantly, this should answer the “So What” question? What changes if your proposed solution actually works?

\section{Intuition}

    This should answer the “How” question.
    State clearly how you are going to design your experiments and what techniques you are using, or what components your novel environments will have.
